# GVP

Small project related to Genshin Impact

## Before Contributing

⚠️ **This repository contains [git submodules](https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/)** ⚠️

Make sure to understand how this feature works, it might be confusing, but anyone should be able to figure it out.
I have decided to use submodules to make it easier for people to write guides that will be published on the website.
The project is essentially a statically generated website, so it had to be done in order to avoid use of cloud 
compute services

Please, see [gvp-guides](https://github.com/kitsune-guuji/gvp-guides), if you would like to publish something!
